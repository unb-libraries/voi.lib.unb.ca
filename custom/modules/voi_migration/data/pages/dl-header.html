<p>Note to users : articles will be automatically extracted by Microsoft Excel, however, Excel does not allow more than 32, 767 characters per cell. Some of the articles in the database exceed this limit, and this can cause users to receive an error message that the cell data is too large. To avoid this, after completing the "Extraction" phase, when prompted to save or open the file, do not open it using Excel. Instead, open it using Microsoft Word. The documents and metadata will then appear in table format and the articles will be whole.</p>
